# Scalable Init Support
This mod enables a limitless amount of init-based VScript mods to be active at the same time, so long as all relevant VScript addons conform to this mod's standard.

Developers, please read the header of scripts/vscripts/game/gameinit.lua in this addon's files for the necessary information to integrate its functionality into your own mod.
